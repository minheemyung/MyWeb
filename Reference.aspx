                    <p>My name is Adriana.  I'm a Gynocologist and Obstetrician in Venezuela.  I've been in Canada for thirteen years, working as a Research Coordinator, doing research involving pregnant women with breast cancer, and type 1 and 2 diabetes. I met Minhee about six years ago and was fortunate to work with her for a period of four years at Sunnybrook Hospital. We worked in a research study involving pregnat women with diabetes, and Minnie was the IT person who helped us create a database where we could collect and analyze data.  When Minhee first landed in Canada, her English proficiency was very basic, however in a short peirod of time she was able to acheive high scores on her academic English tests, which subsequently allowed her to attend college.  It was awesome to witness firsthand how quickly Minhee improved her English communication skills in the worksplace, as a result of her determination to overcome any barriers.  She is a highly motivated individual!  
                        <br />
It is also quite noteworthy to mention how impressed I was to see Minnie quickly advanced in her own department.  She started off as a programmer, and through hard work, determination, and diligence, Minhee was soon promoted to Magagement level status.  Minhee would always finish whatever she started, even if it meant staying at work long after hours, which she often did.  This was very impressive to me.  
                        <br />
Minhee was also an innovator of great ideas, always bringing to the table new and efficient suggestions for the team to implement!  Simply put, she wanted to make data collection more streamlined, and easier for our departments to collect.  Minhee also had this unique ability to combine our medical language/knowledge with her advanced programming skills, to create something that we could all understand and use.  She definitely made all of our jobs much easier!
                        <br />
Since our teams at Sunnybrook handle confidential material on a regular basis, Minhee always took meticulous care and responsibility in the safeguarding of all sensitive materials and information.  Minhee was also ethical and professional when making decisions regarding hiring new personnel, and also demonstrated leadership and professionalism when handling minor conflict resolutions within our departments.  
                        <br />
I am delighted and privileged to write this recommendation for Minhee! I can say with complete confidence and certainty that any workplace or company would benefit from having her on their team.  She is an excellent asset to have at your side!  
                        <br />
Should you require any more information about Minhee, please feel free to contact me, I would be more than happy to assist.

                    <p>I worked with Minhee Myung at Sunnybrook Research Institute in the Clinical Trial Services (CTS) unit from 2014 to 2017. During this time, I worked as a Senior Project Manager and Minhee was the Senior Programmer. I am currently working as a Senior Project Manager at the Hospital for Sick Children on an international pediatric arthritis study in personalized medicine.  
<br />
As a team leader to Project Managers and Project Coordinators at CTS, I worked closely with the team and Minhee to prioritize tasks and ensure project timelines were met. We had between 8-10 ongoing projects that all require programming, from report generation, form development in Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems (such as REDCap and OpenClinica), and data analysis. Minhee was responsible for understanding each project and the team requests, and delivering them on a timely basis. This was a challenging role, since she had to learn to work with many different personalities and complexity of each project. 
<br />
Minhee is smart, efficient and always willing to learn new tasks. She was always thoughtful in how to approach a problem and provide solutions with realistic timelines. Minhee stepped up and worked very hard when another programmer resigned while working on a final analysis for a $10 million project I was leading. We were scheduled to present and publish results within 1.5 months. During this time, she was able to maintain the programming needs for the unit, as well as complete the tasks required for the final analysis to meet the tight timeline. Minhee was detailed oriented, always checked her work before handing them over to the team, and delivered the results on a timely manner. If it wasn’t for Minhee’s significant contribution, we would not have been able to complete the analysis for the scheduled final presentation and publication.
<br />
Minhee is an outstanding candidate and I highly recommend her to any IT position she is applying for.

I am database manager in a clinical trial until at Sunnybrook Hospital.  I've worked with Minhee for over 3 years.  Minhee is determined, a great problem solver and works well in a team or individually.
              
Working with her for me was very enjoyable.
                        <br />
One of the major projects I worked with Minhee was building a randomization website.  The website involved a medical personnel to login, answer a series of eligibility questions and based on the answers, query an SQL database and return information to be assigned to the patient.
                        <br />
Minhee is very knowledgeable and brings alot of IT experience to the table.  She is a creative problem solver and very understanding of everyone's need.  She manages her time well and willing to ask for help when she needs it.  She is also not afraid to speak her mind if she does not share your point of view, while doing so in a respectful manner.

                      and knowledge when they are in need. I truly enjoyed working with Minhee, and I highly recommend her for any position that she is up for.

                    <p>I am a Senior Business Analyst at TD Bank and I had Minhee as my programming tutor for object programming language and Web-Development back in 2012 Fall. Thank to her in-depth industry experience, I was able to learn lots of real-world problems and how to approach/solve them which I hadn't had opportunities to experience from school education or even the internet. As an instructor, Minhee was very detail-oriented and patient when explaining complex concepts of programming and its algorithms. I found that She possessed a great amount of knowledge in this area. 
                        <br />
                        I truly appreciate her ability to always balance between what's in theory and reality which provided me great perspectives. They all together absolutely helped me land my first job  and became a solid foundation for my skills until today.</p>
